# USE-OF-TIMERS-IN-TRAFFIC-LIGHT-CONTROLLER
Traffic light controllers play a critical role in managing the flow of vehicles and pedestrians at  intersections, ensuring safety and efficiency. Timers are integral components of these systems,  providing the necessary control and coordination to manage traffic signal transitions effectively.


Traffic congestion is a growing problem in urban areas, leading to delays, pollution, and safety 
concerns. Traffic light controllers equipped with timers are fundamental in mitigating these issues by regulating the flow of vehicles and pedestrians. Timers manage the duration of signal phases, operating based on pre-configured intervals or adaptive algorithms.


# Objectives: 
The objectives of this study are: 

1. To evaluate the limitations of existing timer systems in traffic light controllers. 

2. To develop a model integrating adaptive timers for optimized traffic flow. 

3. To assess the proposed system's performance against existing models through simulation

# Conclusion: 
Timers are indispensable in traffic light controllers, offering control and adaptability to manage intersections efficiently.

capabilities of timer-based traffic systems. Detailed discussions and extended simulations 
substantiate these conclusions, aligning with the objectives of smart city initiatives.
